This is a project about scraping data from the web about filings. The files include
8-k, 10-K and 10-Q. The data to be extracted include:
financial info
date 
signed by 
state
file number
its employer identification no
phone number
address

1. The first step is to first log into the site daily listings. 
2. The second is to identify those filings listed above.
3. Then, after finding those required filings, proceed to its link to extract the financial info 
and all other info above.
4. Save the info to a csv.


Advanced approach
This involves data structuring, cleaning and maipulating to ensure that we get the required data.
Notes:
1. One company could make two submissions of different filings. Order is static.
So for every filings, validate it with it's category and date before extracting info from it.
2. Also, there is /A to the filing categories, which too should be scraped.
3. Some information about financial stuff of some filings do not exist. Find a way to deal with 
the issue. Possible solutions: ignore them or write financial info as Null
4. Find all the similarities between the pages and organize how the web scraper will handle
and extract data.
5. List down all the financial data to be obtained which is common in all.


Ooooh no! It seems web scraping is usually not that easy like you had imagined especially where
data is fed to the web page via json
